<h3 id="project-description">Project Description</h3>
<p>This project was designed to <strong>Help contact centre workers deal with and de-escalate contacts where a caller is angry or frustrated.</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="my-aims">My Aims</h3>
<p>I created an innovative e-learning module that empowers contact center advisors to effectively handle difficult calls by de-escalating customer frustration before it intensifies. This approach not only calms the situation but also prevents potential escalation.</p>
<p>My journey into instructional design and e-learning development has been enriched by free Coursera courses, deep online research, insightful YouTube tutorials, detailed industry blogs, and newsletters from top experts. Additionally, my extensive experience in customer-centric roles across the retail, security, energy, and broadband industries has refined my soft skills and conflict resolution strategies.</p>
<p>For this project, I harnessed the power of generative AI to develop both the audio and visual components. I employed Midjourney for creating compelling images and Elevenlabs.io for high-quality voice generation, while the foundational storyboard was crafted in Microsoft Word and PowerPoint.</p>
