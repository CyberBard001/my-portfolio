    <p>About Me</p>
<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Stuart Gibson! ðŸš€
Iâ€™m a lifelong learner, training facilitator, and instructional designer who thrives on helping others grow. Whether it&rsquo;s through facilitating training sessions, designing engaging learning experiences, or mentoring new talent, Iâ€™m always excited to support others on their journey to success.</p>
<p>My Journey into Training Facilitation &amp; Instructional Design
In 2021, I officially stepped into the world of training as a Training Facilitator at Firstsource Solutions Ltdâ€”and Iâ€™ve loved every minute of it! Initially, I worked in the sales training team for a broadband company, where I developed my facilitation skills, ensuring that training was engaging, adaptable, and effective for a wide range of learners.</p>
<p>From there, I expanded into customer service training, helping new hires develop the skills needed to handle complex customer interactions with confidence.</p>
<p>After a period of returning to frontline customer support, I took a new challenge in the energy sectorâ€”a completely different field but one that has been incredibly rewarding.</p>
<p>Diving into the Energy Sector: A New Challenge ðŸ”‹
For eight months, I worked directly with energy customers, handling complex billing queries, supporting vulnerable customers, and helping resolve debt issues before they escalated. This gave me first-hand experience in the challenges customers face and deepened my understanding of the British energy market.</p>
<p>Now, Iâ€™ve returned to the training department, where I facilitate new hire training for energy sector employees. My role involves helping new employees navigate:
âœ… Smart meters &amp; energy efficiency
âœ… Complex billing &amp; account management
âœ… Supporting vulnerable customers
âœ… Debt resolution &amp; financial assistance programs</p>
<p>It has been a challenging but uplifting experience, and itâ€™s a privilege to see so many skilled professionals pass through my training sessions and grow into their roles.</p>
<p>Expanding into Instructional Design ðŸŽ¨
Beyond facilitation, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to design training programs that optimize learning while reducing time-to-competency. My team was tasked with creating a three-week induction program for broadband sales and service repsâ€”but through strategic instructional design, we successfully optimized it to two weeks while maintaining the same high competency standards.</p>
<p>We achieved this by leveraging:
ðŸŽ¯ Articulate Storyline 360 &amp; Rise 360
ðŸŽ¯ Scenario-based learning &amp; real-world simulations
ðŸŽ¯ Engaging activities tailored to different learning styles</p>
<p>Beyond Work: My Passions &amp; Interests ðŸ“š
Iâ€™ve always been drawn to learning, creativity, and storytellingâ€”which extends into my personal projects. Iâ€™ve run two e-commerce venturesâ€”one focused on tech &amp; gadgets (think retro gaming consoles!) and another dedicated to Game of Thrones merchandise. Each venture taught me valuable lessons about innovation, perseverance, and customer engagement.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m also passionate about epic fantasy books (Brandon Sandersonâ€™s Cosmere, The Wheel of Time), 3D printing, home brewing, and digital content creation.</p>
<p>At the heart of it all, I love helping others growâ€”whether itâ€™s training new hires, mentoring colleagues, or designing learning experiences. Seeing people develop their skills and gain confidence is what drives me every day.</p>
