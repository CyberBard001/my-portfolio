## Articulate Storyline Module - From Rage to Resolution

### Project Description  
This project was designed to **help contact centre workers deal with and de-escalate contacts where a caller is angry or frustrated**.

### My Aims  
I created an innovative e-learning module that empowers contact center advisors to effectively handle difficult calls by de-escalating customer frustration before it intensifies. This approach not only calms the situation but also prevents potential escalation.

My journey into instructional design and e-learning development has been enriched by free Coursera courses, deep online research, insightful YouTube tutorials, detailed industry blogs, and newsletters from top experts. Additionally, my extensive experience in customer-centric roles across the retail, security, energy, and broadband industries has refined my soft skills and conflict resolution strategies.

For this project, I harnessed the power of generative AI to develop both the audio and visual components. I employed Midjourney for creating compelling images and Elevenlabs.io for high-quality voice generation, while the foundational storyboard was crafted in Microsoft Word and PowerPoint.
