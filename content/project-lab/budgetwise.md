Quid Keeper is a lightweight income and expenditure tracker designed to help individuals and families manage their money more clearly. It supports income and bills, frequency settings, essential vs flexible spending, and smart summaries to guide budgeting decisions.

This project began as a personal learning exercise in React and grew into a tool I use and improve frequently. Some future updates will be a name change, as there are other similarly named tools, savings goals for multiple savings pots, cheaper options for current subscriptions and services and much more.
