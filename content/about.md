About Me

Hi there I am Stuart Gibson! I’m a lifelong learner and passionate entrepreneur who loves to dive into new challenges. I’ve always believed that the journey is as important as the destination, and I embrace each project with enthusiasm—even if it means facing setbacks along the way. If something doesn’t work out the first time, I’m quick to adapt, learn, and move on to my next adventure.

My professional journey has been as varied as my interests. I’ve run two e-commerce ventures—one focused on tech and gadgets (think retro game consoles and other cool tech) and another that catered to fans with unofficial Game of Thrones merchandise. Each project has taught me valuable lessons about innovation, perseverance, and the art of connecting with a community.

Beyond work, my passions span from the realms of epic literature and television to hands-on creative pursuits. I’m an avid fan of series and books like Game of Thrones, The Wheel of Time, and Brandon Sanderson’s Cosmere (including Mistborn and The Stormlight Archive). I’ve even dabbled in hobbies such as 3D printing and home brewing—each providing its own unique set of challenges and rewards.

At the heart of it all is my love for family and my commitment to helping others grow. Whether I’m training colleagues or mentoring friends, I’m dedicated to supporting those around me as they develop their skills and reach their potential. As a parent to a young family, my greatest joy is nurturing an environment where my children—and those I work with—can flourish into the best versions of themselves.

Thanks for stopping by and joining me on this exciting journey of continuous learning and growth!
